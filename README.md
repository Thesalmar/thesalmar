I experienced some stacks in the past : C and Python
I was coding a lot when I was at [EPITECH](https://www.epitech.eu/en) but it didn't went as expected and I quit this school 2 years after entering it.

Now, I am more focused on working with other subjects such as Systems & Networks, SaaS apps and side jobs that aren't fully connected to IT.

My favorite distro on Linux is [Debian](https://www.debian.org) and you can find my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/Thesalmar/t_dotfiles) here.
I don't go on Github often because I don't code that much now compared to a few years ago.

My favorite tools are :
- [Raindrop](https://www.raindrop.io) : Pretty useful to store your favorite links and having nested/categorized collections.
- [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/intl/en/) : A friendly/Gmail-like interface when you have domain names. 
- ~~[Wallmine](https://www.wallmine.com) : A very good tool when you manage a stock portfolio (Doesn't works yet on other products like bonds nor the Tokyo Stock Exchange)~~ Site has been closed down around Sept-Oct 2024
- [Lovable.dev](https://www.lovable.dev) : I have my personal JP website generated and managed through this tool. Very useful for no-code programming.

This is only a tiny part of my tools. Don't hesitate to contact me for more !
